Nigeria has experienced several epidemics in recent years, including Lassa fever, Cholera, M. Pox and COVID-19. The media has played a critical role in informing the public and holding the government accountable during these outbreaks. However, journalists often face challenges in covering epidemics, including limited access to information, misinformation, and disinformation. Nigeria Health Watch is calling for applications to be a part of a fellowship program for outstanding local journalists based in Abuja, Lagos and Kano States with a passion for covering epidemic preparedness. The program will provide fellows with a comprehensive training on epidemic preparedness and response, including workshops, field visits, mentorship, and coaching from experienced journalists and public health experts. Fellows will also receive financial support for the 2-month period, to complete their reporting, as well as continued coaching and support accessing national and international data and contacts, among other benefits.
