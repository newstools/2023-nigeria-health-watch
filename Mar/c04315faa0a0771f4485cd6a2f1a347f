Nigeria Health Watch is pleased to announce a call for applications for the Collaborative Solutions Journalism grant. This grant is open to newsrooms, journalists, and freelancers who are well-versed in Solutions Journalism and can collaborate to pitch projects and stories. The grant provides mini-grants (up to N1,000,000) to support five successful submissions. About the Grant Solutions Journalism is a type of reporting that delivers rigorous, investigative, and evidence-based reports of responses to various social problems. Unlike problem-focused reporting, Solutions Journalism highlights how people are addressing similar problems in multiple locations, making peer learning possible. The grant encourages media outlets, journalists, freelancers, and storytellers of all forms to pitch Solutions Journalism stories or projects as a team. Who Can Apply? What We Are Looking For How to Apply Interested teams should complete the online form (https://forms.gle/b5BbCVUgxwAmuHMU9). Only applications sent via the online application portal will be considered. One person can apply on behalf of a team.
